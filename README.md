# Dataminded skillboost exercise

This exercise has been created specifically for DM to illustrate refactoring.
The goal is to refactor the code to make it more readable as well as extendable.

## Getting started

- install uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
- create a virtual environment: `uv venv`
- sourcing the environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- syncing the dependencies: `uv sync`
- making sure everything works: `pytest` 

Start reworking the code.
