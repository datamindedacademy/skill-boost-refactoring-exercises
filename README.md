# Dataminded skillboost exercise

This exercise has been created specifically for DM to illustrate refactoring.
The goal is to refactor the code to make it more readable as well as extendable.

## New requirements
Let's expand our example with the 2 most obvious changes:

- Add HTML version of our invoice
- Add CSM to our invoice: are always senior and have a base of of 1200 per day. No discounts made for them

## Getting started

- install uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
- create a virtual environment: `uv venv`
- sourcing the environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- syncing the dependencies: `uv sync`
- making sure everything works: `pytest` 

Start reworking the code.
